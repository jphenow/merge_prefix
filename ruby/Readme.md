# Ruby!

You'll need Ruby installed (I built/tested using 1.9.2, so 
not sure about 1.8.6) then either:

    ruby MergePrefixes.rb

or

    ./MergePrefixes.rb

**_NOTE_** Ruby implementation does not currently use the lists
in merge_prefix/lists/, because of an odd encoding issue. I will
be looking into this as time allows.
